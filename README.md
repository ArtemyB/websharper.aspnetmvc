# WebSharper.AspNetMvc

This library allows you to run [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) within or alongside an ASP.NET MVC application. It enables:

* Including WebSharper client-side controls in Razor pages (ASPX pages are already covered by WebSharper);
* Calling WebSharper RPC functions (server-side functions called seamlessly from the client) from such controls;
* Running WebSharper sitelets and their custom routing alongside ASP.NET MVC's own routing.

To learn how to use it, please refer to [the WebSharper documentation](http://websharper.com/docs/aspnet).
